My tasks for these courses:
* [DMET 901: Computer Vision](http://met.guc.edu.eg/Courses/Info.aspx?crsEdId=846)
* [DMET 902: Advanced Video Processing](http://met.guc.edu.eg/Courses/Info.aspx?crsEdId=847)
* [DMET 1001: Image Processing](http://met.guc.edu.eg/Courses/Info.aspx?crsEdId=899)
* [DMET 1002: Image Processing Lab](http://met.guc.edu.eg/Courses/Info.aspx?crsEdId=900)

Note: for MATLAB files, I have included all the needed functions as [local functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/local-functions.html) at the end of the script of every algorithm instead of saving each one of them separately, but this demands R2016b or higher. It is best to view scripts as [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-live-scripts.html) for convenience.
